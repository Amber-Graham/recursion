Practicing recursion for TOP using Ruby.

The first method `def fib` returns an array with each number from the sequence.
The second method `merge_sort` returns a sorted array utilizing the merge_sort
function recursively. 

I was able to find and learn many different ways to do this both methods. Each method was 
unique in its own right and was interesting to see how the user came up with 
their method. 

For `merge_sort`, I figured the easiest way to split everything was to define a 
variable `middle` for the array and split it up using `round` if there was 
an odd number in the array. Not totally necessary, but I liked that it helped
me see what I was dividing up rather than doing it all in one line using `slice`. 
The CS50 explanation of merge sort was awesome and helped me get pseudocode down in
order to get the ball rolling. 

Overall, recursion is very interesting and I can see its need for certain situations.
